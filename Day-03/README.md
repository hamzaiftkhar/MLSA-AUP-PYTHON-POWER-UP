Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing well.

Day 3 of Python workshop has successfully concluded, where we covered these topics:

- Introduction to Loops
- While loop
- For loop
- Nested Loops

Also, we have did some tasks during the class and learn about some extra concepts such as:

- Why last index in programming starts from -1 and not from 0 or 1.
- Fact about Loop.

Now, it's time for an assignment to put your knowledge to the test:

### Question-1:
Write a Python program that lets a user guess a secret number between 1 and 100. The program should provide hints whether the guessed number is too high or too low, and it should continue until the correct number is guessed.

Instructions:
1.	The computer selects a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2.	You start by guessing a number within that range.
3.	The game tells you whether your guess is too high or too low.
4.	You continue guessing numbers based on the feedback until you guess the correct number.
5.	The game displays the number of attempts it took you to guess correctly.


### Question-2:
Guess the hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. You have a limited number of attempts before the "hangman" is complete.

Instructions:
1.	The computer selects a random word from a predefined list.
2.	The game displays the number of letters in the word as underscores, representing unguessed letters.
3.	You guess a letter by entering it.
4.	If the guessed letter is in the word, the corresponding underscores are replaced with the letter.
5.	If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn (e.g., head, body, arms, legs).
6.	You continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.
7.	If you guess the word, you win! If the hangman is fully drawn before you guess the word, you lose.
