### Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing well.

We successfully concluded Day 2 of the 10-day Python workshop, where we covered the following topics:

- Built-in Data Structures in Python
- What is List?
- List Operations
- What is Tuple?
- Difference between tuple and list
- Tuple Operations
- What is Dictionary?
- Dictionary operations

Also, we have did a task on list during the class and learn about some extra concepts such as:

- Variable swapping in python
- Why index starts with zero?

Now, it's time for an assignment to put your knowledge to the test:

### Question-1:
Lists and Tuples You have been given the following data:

temperatures = [25, 30, 27, 22, 28, 33, 29] 
days = ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday') 

a. Create a new list containing the temperature and day pairs as tuples. 
b. Find the maximum temperature from the list and print it along with the corresponding day. 
c. Calculate and print the average temperature.


### Question-2: 
Nested Dictionaries You are managing a library. Here's the information about some books:

books = { 'book1': { 'title': 'The Great Gatsby', 'author': 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 'year': 1925 }, 'book2': { 'title': 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'author': 'Harper Lee', 'year': 1960 }, 'book3': { 'title': '1984', 'author': 'George Orwell', 'year': 1949 } } 

a. Add a new book to the dictionary with the title, author, and year. 

b. Print the titles of all the books. 

c. Determine the book with the earliest publication year and print its title and author.
