#### Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing well.

We successfully concluded Day 1 of the 10-day Python workshop, where we covered the following topics:

- Understanding Programming
- Overview of Programming Languages
- Introduction to Python
- The History of Python
- Input and Output in Python
- Variables and Their Usage
- DataTypes and Typecasting
- String Operations
- Conditional Statements using if/elif/else

Now, it's time for an assignment to put your knowledge to the test:

#### Question-1: Number Range Checker 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number. Check whether the number falls within any of the following ranges:
0-10: "Low Range"
11-50: "Medium Range"
51-100: "High Range"
Outside of 0-100: "Out of Range"

#### Question-2:Leap Year Checker 
Write a program that asks the user to input a year and determines whether the year is a leap year or not. A leap year is either divisible by 4 but not by 100, or divisible by 400.
