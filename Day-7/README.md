# Day-07

Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing well.

Day 7 of Python workshop has successfully concluded, where we covered these topics:

- What is polymorphism?
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism in inheritance

Now, it's time for an assignment to put your knowledge to the test:

Question: Shopping Cart
1. Create a class named CartItem to represent items in the cart. Include attributes like name, price, quantity, and a method calculate_item_price().

2. Create subclasses for different item types, e.g., ElectronicsItem and ClothingItem etc. Override the calculate_item_price() method in each subclass.

3. Establish a class named ShoppingCart to represent the cart. Include an attribute items (a list) to store added items. Implement methods add_item(), remove_item(), and show_cart().

4. Inside the ShoppingCart class, implement a method calculate_total_price() to sum the prices of all items in the cart.

5. Instantiate objects of various item subclasses. Add these items to a ShoppingCart instance using add_item(). Call calculate_total_price() on the cart to show the total price.

6. Create instances of items and the cart. Add items to the cart. Calculate and display the total cart price using calculate_total_price().
