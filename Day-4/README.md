# Day-4

Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing well.

Day 4 of Python workshop has successfully concluded, where we covered these topics:

- Introduction to Functions
- Types of Functions
- Functions with parameter and return value
- Functions without parameter and return value
- Exception Handling in Python

Also, we did a task during the class and learn about some extra concepts such as:

- Who was the first programmer?
- Myth about programming which is "More Code = Better Solution"

Now, it's time for an assignment to put your knowledge to the test:

Question-1: Creating a Basic Calculator

You are tasked with creating a simple calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. You need to create functions for each of these operations and allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

Requirements:

1. Create four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Each function should take two arguments (the two numbers to perform the operation on) and return the result of the operation.
2. Create a function named calculator that presents a menu to the user with options for each operation. The user should be able to input their choice, as well as the two numbers for the operation.
3. After performing the selected operation, display the result to the user.


Question-2: Word Frequency Counter

Create a program that reads a text input from the user and then calculates the frequency of each word in the input. You need to create a function that takes the text as input, processes it, and returns a dictionary with the word frequencies.

Requirements:

1. Create a function named word frequency that takes a string (text input) as an argument.
2. Inside the function, tokenize the input string into words (split by spaces and punctuation).
3. Count the frequency of each word and store the results in a dictionary.
4. The keys of the dictionary should be the unique words, and the values should be the corresponding frequencies.
5. Ignore the case of the words (convert all words to lowercase) to treat "Word" and "word" as the same word.
6. Display the word frequencies to the user in a clear and organized format.
